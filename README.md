===============================

How to start the game? Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

How to play the game
===============================

1. The player starts off at the starting point in the grassy area. You must make your way up to the waters without colliding into an enemy bug.
2. If you collide with any of the enemy bugs, you will restart in the starting point.
3. If you successfully reach the water without colliding with any of the enemy bugs….Congrats! You’ve won.
4. You can replay the game after you’ve won.
